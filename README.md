## About

Hello! I'm Adrian, and I've built **RowerTrain** - a powerful rowing machine app designed specifically for indoor rowing machines to enhance your training experience and boost your rowing performance.

This rowing training software works smoothly with a wide range of rowing ergometers, including popular models from Domyos, Concept2, Christopeit, Merach, and other FTMS-compatible rowing machines.

Simply connect your rowing machine to your smartphone via Bluetooth and start your rowing workout session. Your rower must support the FTMS (Fitness Machine Service) Bluetooth protocol to work with RowerTrain.
