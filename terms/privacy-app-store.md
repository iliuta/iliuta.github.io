# Privacy Policy for RowerTrain

**Effective Date:** February 6, 2026  
**Last Updated:** February 6, 2026

At **RowerTrain**, we value your privacy while striving to provide the best possible rowing experience. This policy explains what data we process and why.

## 1. Fitness Data (Local)
Your core fitness data (power, stroke rate, heart rate, distance, and calories) is **stored locally on your device**. 
- The developer has no access to your specific training history.
- This data stays on your phone unless you choose to export it to third-party services.

## 2. Analytics & Improvement
To help us improve the App's stability and compatibility with various rowing machines, we use **Google Firebase Analytics**.
- **What is collected:** Anonymous usage statistics (e.g., which screens are visited, app crashes, or connection success rates with fitness equipment).
- **Purpose:** To identify bugs and understand which features are most used.
- **Privacy:** This data is **aggregated and anonymized**. It cannot be used to identify you personally.

## 3. Third-Party Services (Optional)

### Strava
The App offers an optional integration with **Strava**. 
- If you link your account, RowerTrain uploads your workout data directly to Strava. 
- This connection is only established with your explicit consent. 
- Please refer to [Strava's Privacy Policy](https://www.strava.com/legal/privacy) for their data handling practices.

## 4. Hardware Permissions

### Bluetooth
The App requires Bluetooth access solely to:
- Connect to your FTMS-compatible rowing machine or bike trainer.
- Receive real-time performance data.
- This hardware data is never shared with the developer, except for anonymous connection success/failure events via Firebase.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Effective Date".
