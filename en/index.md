## About

Hello! I'm Adrian, and I've built **RowerTrain** - an app for connected rowers, designed to enhance your training experience and boost your rowing performance.

I originally wrote this app for Decathlon Domyos rowers. It turned out that Decathlon decided to stop maintaining the Domyos eConnected app and direct users to the Kinomap app. I didn't find that app very useful, so I decided to create my own.

RowerTrain works with a wide range of rowing ergometers, including popular models like Domyos 500, 900, Woodrower as well as other brands like Concept2, Christopeit, Merach, and others. If your rower doesn't work with RowerTrain, please let me know. Sometimes rowers, especially entry-level models, don't fully comply with the FTMS protocol. However, thanks to user feedback, I've been able to fix some issues and improve compatibility.

Simply connect your rowing machine to your smartphone via Bluetooth and start your rowing workout session. Your rower must support the Bluetooth FTMS (Fitness Machine Service) protocol to work with RowerTrain.

## Note on the Proposed Training Sessions

The provided training sessions are given as examples. If you find they don't suit you, you can create your own training sessions using the built-in editor. You can also report any issues or errors you encounter so I can fix them.

## Contact & Feedback

I spend a lot of my free time maintaining this app and making it as useful as possible. It is available for free on Google Play. If you wish to support the development of the app, you can make a donation via [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/iliuta). It's not mandatory but the appreciations always make me happy and motivate me to continue. Don't hesitate to leave a comment on Google Play to make the app even more visible and popular.

The app is also available on the Apple App Store. You can download it for free and use the "Free Ride" mode. This will allow you to test the app and see if it works with your rower. However, to use other features, you will need to make an in-app purchase.
